- [ ] Data/communication lines verified (if hybrid tether)

---

## Phase 5: Power System Verification

### Ground Station Power
- [ ] Input voltage within spec
- [ ] Output voltage set correctly for tether length
- [ ] Current limiting configured
- [ ] Thermal sensors reading normal
- [ ] Cooling fans operational

### Aircraft Power

- [ ] Motor direction correct
- [ ] No abnormal vibration or noise
- [ ] ESC temperatures normal after test

---

## Phase 7: Final Launch Authorization

### Personnel
- [ ] All team members briefed on test objectives
- [ ] Emergency roles assigned
- [ ] Communication protocol confirmed
- [ ] Non-essential personnel clear of area

### Environmental Recheck
